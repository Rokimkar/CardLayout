# CardLayout

Project is focused on achieving a view such that in a collection view a cell will be elevated(rised) with respect to other cells, and it will give a zoomed effect.

Problems faced while developing it:

### I) The cells while dragging never stooped on the focused cell.
### II) While moving the collection view frame, which is linked to slider layout of the cells were not working well.
### III) Extract the cell on which layout is to be performed.
Solution of these problem were handled in this project.
Now,CollectionView cells are arranged in stacked manner and are horizontally scrollable.
